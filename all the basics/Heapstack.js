//as we know variables dont posses the values of the data but just are a reference and point to the data present in the heap
let anothername = "myYoutubeName";
let namey = anothername;

console.log(anothername);
console.log(namey);

//the reference is same for both variable so making anychanges to them will get changed in both of them
